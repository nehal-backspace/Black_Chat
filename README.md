# Black Chat
It is a Secret Chat App which hides behind a normal commercial Apps.

## Story behind

In the mid of this Panedamic Covid-19 one day, my friend called me and said bro my partner's parents called me yesterday and told me not to talk to his daughter as they caught us chatting in late night and have seen all the WhatsApp messages. My friend added that her parents are keeping eye on her and her all mobile chat Apps. Since his relationship is new *(just about 2months)* he is missing her badly and wanted to know badly ~~(babu ne Thana Thaya ya nai)~~ whether she ate food or not.

In mid of his sorrowful story he wished If there exists some App in which he can chat very very secretly.....

This way I got my  Problem Statement along with Constraints.

## Download and Installation
Go to (https://blackchat.ml)  Register your name and create your Master Key then Download any one of the available App.
Once it is installed , when you open the App you will find an input field asking for your mobile number.

Enter Your Master Key and click the Continue (or get OTP) button.
if your master is correct the screen changes and you will enter into chat App else you will get the Error message.
Now you can Create or Join Rooms to Chat. 

## Features
1.The App will have the icon and complete UI of a daily using apps for example Lenskart or Airtel,So from outside no one can guess that it is a Chat App.

2.The app supports **customizable Notifications** that means you can choose/edit the notifications that you want to receive on every new message.

3.The Chats are encrypted and App gets **automatically logged out with a faded screen** on going into the background every time.

4.One chat room can support more than **400 users**.
